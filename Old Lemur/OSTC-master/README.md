Open Source Tracking Collar for small mammal and wildlife tracking.

This is a GPS tracking collar, originally designed for the purpose of tracking lemurs in Madagascar, but designed to be hackable, editable, and easily usable by other researchers for their various needs.

Much of the design is built upon Adafruit Industries feather boards and code, which means that parts are easy to source, instead of having to get a custom board made.

The design consists of two parts: the tracking device and the base station. The tracking device is attached to the animal to collect GPS location and accelerometer data for as long as needed. The base station is brought within radio range to retrieve the data.

See the doc folder for more in-depth information.
